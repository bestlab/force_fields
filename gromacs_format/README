Various force fields, in Gromacs format.

Chromophore force fields are included in amber03-star, amber03w and amber03ws

For CHARMM force fields in Gromacs format, please see Alex Mackerell's website:

Some details:

amber03-star: amber ff03* (Best, Hummer, 2009) 
amber99sb-star: amber ff99SB* (Best, Hummer, 2009)
amber99sb-star-ildn: amber ff99SB*-ILDN (Best, Hummer, 2009 and Lindorff-Larsen et al, Proteins, 2011 for ILDN part)
amber99sb-star-ildn-q: amber ff99SB*-ILDN-q (same as above, but with backbone charge mods 
                                             as described in Best, De Sancho, Mittal, Biophys. J. 2012)
amber03w: amber ff03w (Best, Mittal, 2010)
amber03ws: amber ff03ws (Best, Zheng, Mittal, 2014)
amber99sbw: amber ff99SBw (ref?)
amber99sbws: amber ff99SBws (Best, Zheng, Mittal, 2014 -- see the SI)

denaturants-amber03ws: urea and gdmcl force fields (Zheng, Best, JCTC, 2015)

AMBER-DYES-1.0_patched: simple fix to original AMBER-DYES force field (Graen et al, JCTC, 2014). 
		The original force field contained a rather minor and likely inconsequential
		error in the covalent bonding of the maleimide-derived conjugates, which this
		patch seeks to fix. Described in more detail in the containd README

How to install? 
	- Copy the needed folders to your gromacs "top" directory, or to the local directory
	where you are setting up your simulation. 

Which protein force field should I use? 
	- All force fields should give reasonable properties for folded proteins, although these
	will be slightly destabilized by the 03ws and 99sbws variants. However for simulations
	of intrinsically disordered or unfolded proteins, of protein-protein interactions, and 
	of protein-dye conjugates, it is recommended to use ff03ws or ff99sbws.

Which chromophore force field should I use?
	- For the frequently used Alexa488 and Alexa594 chromophores, the best validated 
	force field is the one included with amber03ws and amber99sbws and is therefore 
	recommended. Setup is described in the dyes_example folder one level above here.
	- For other chromophores, an extensive library is provided by the patched 
	AMBER-DYES distribution. However, it should also be used with one of the 
	water-scaling force fields in order that the chromophores do not stick excessively 
	to the protein. Setup is described in the README and example setup script in 
	the AMBER-DYES-1.0_patched folder on level up.
